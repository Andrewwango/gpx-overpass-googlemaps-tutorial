# How to find places along a GPX route in Python using Overpass API and Google Maps Places API

Do you have some long GPX routes, for long hikes, pub crawls or pilgrimages? How can you automatically find what amenities are near the route, and reduce the amount you spend using paid APIs?

In this tutorial, we find places in OpenStreetMap along our route, using the free Overpass API. Then, we use the Google Maps Places API for each place of interest to retrieve up-to-date place ratings, reviews, photos and opening hours.

Doing it this way has a couple of advantages:

- We can easily query places along a route using the Overpass API, much easier than using Google Maps.
- We will save money doing the heavy searching on the free OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps, and only using Google Maps to get place details.
